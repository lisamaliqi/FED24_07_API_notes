## Step 1 - Room Service anyone? 🍽️

Create `services/room_service.ts` and move Prisma-logic for the `Room` model to the service.

* `getRooms()`
* `getRoom(roomId)`

## Step 2 - `Message` Prisma Model

Create Prisma model for a `Message`.

* `content`
* `roomId`
* `timestamp`
* `username`

## Step 3 - Save it! 💾

When the server receives a message, create a new `Message` and save it to the database.

Create `services/message_service.ts` and the method `createMessage(message)`.

## Step 4 - Retrieve it! 🐶

When a user joins a room, retrieve the latest messages for that room. Limit the messages to those sent during the past 24 hours but a maximum of 100 messages.
Add the messages to the chat.
