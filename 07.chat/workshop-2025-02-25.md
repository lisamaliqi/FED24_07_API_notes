## Step 1 - Create user 🍼👶🏻

When a user joins a room, create them in the database and set their roomId.

## Step 2 - Retrieve users 🏊🏻🚣🏻

Retrieve a list of online users for the room and send the list to
the user that joins the room (so they know who's online).

## (Step 3) - Remove user when disconnects/leaves 💀

When a user rage-quits, delete them from the database (as we don't want passive-agressive users).
